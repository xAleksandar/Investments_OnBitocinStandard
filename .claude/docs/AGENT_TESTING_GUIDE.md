# Agent Testing Guide

## ‚ö° CRITICAL: NO SERVER STARTUP REQUIRED

**Development server is managed by user - agents NEVER start servers**

## üéØ Pre-Test Protocol

### 1. URL Verification

- ‚úÖ **Test URL**: Use URL provided by main Claude (never assume port numbers)
- ‚úÖ **Pre-flight**: Verify URL responds before testing (5 seconds max)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Run server commands, install dependencies, or assume URLs
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Hardcode localhost:3000 or any port numbers

### 2. System Requirements Check

**Before Testing** - Verify these systems are ready:

- **Express Server**: Running via `npm run dev` (user responsibility)
- **PostgreSQL**: Database server running and accessible
- **Prisma Client**: Generated and up-to-date (`npx prisma generate`)
- **Environment**: `.env` file configured with proper database connection

### 3. If Server Issues

- **Connection Refused**: Report to human immediately - do not troubleshoot
- **404 Error**: Report URL and error - do not attempt fixes
- **Database Errors**: Report Prisma connection issues immediately
- **Slow Response**: Document but continue testing if functional

## üìÅ File Output Restrictions

### CRITICAL: Only write to .temp/ directory

```
.temp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-results/          # Screenshots and detailed findings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-screenshots/      # Visual evidence of issues
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ financial-validation/  # Portfolio calculation test results
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent-reports/         # Structured test reports
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scratch/              # Temporary working files
```

### File Creation Rules

- ‚úÖ **Allow**: Write reports, screenshots, logs to .temp/
- ‚ùå **Block**: Create test files (.spec.js) anywhere
- ‚ùå **Block**: Echo commands for file creation
- ‚ùå **Block**: Write outside .temp/ directory
- ‚ùå **Block**: Modify any project files or configurations

## üîç Measure Everything in Bitcoin Testing Protocol

### Standard Agent Flow

1. **Pre-flight**: Verify provided URL responds (5 seconds max)
2. **System Check**: Confirm database connection and Prisma client status
3. **Financial Focus**: Prioritize testing trading logic and portfolio calculations
4. **Execute**: Run specific test scenario as instructed by main Claude
5. **Document**: Screenshots + findings to .temp/test-results/
6. **Report**: Structured findings with actionable recommendations

### Measure Everything in Bitcoin Specific Responsibilities

- **Financial Accuracy**: Test all money-related calculations with zero tolerance for errors
- **Trading Logic**: Validate 24-hour locks, FIFO selling, and satoshi precision
- **Portfolio Calculations**: Verify real-time valuations and performance metrics
- **Prisma Integration**: Test database queries and BigInt serialization
- **API Fallbacks**: Verify CoinGecko price fetching and fallback mechanisms
- **Security**: Test authentication flows and admin privilege escalation

### What Agents Do NOT Do

- Start or manage servers (Express, PostgreSQL, or any services)
- Decide what to test (main Claude determines scope and priority)
- Create permanent test files or modify project structure
- Make assumptions about database schema or API endpoints
- Troubleshoot infrastructure issues or Prisma migrations
- Modify environment variables or configuration files

## üìä Efficiency Guidelines for Financial Testing

### Time Allocation for Measure Everything in Bitcoin

- **Setup**: 0-5 seconds (just URL verification)
- **Financial Testing**: 60% - Trading system, portfolio calculations, price accuracy
- **User Experience**: 25% - Authentication, UI/UX, real-time updates
- **System Integration**: 15% - API endpoints, database integrity, error handling

### High-Priority Test Areas (Zero Error Tolerance)

1. **Portfolio Valuation**: Current holdings value in satoshis
2. **Trade Execution**: Buy/sell logic with proper BTC conversion
3. **24-Hour Locks**: Purchase lock enforcement and unlock timing
4. **FIFO Selling**: Cost basis calculation accuracy
5. **Satoshi Precision**: No fractional satoshi amounts in any calculation
6. **Performance Metrics**: BTC vs portfolio comparison accuracy

### Medium-Priority Test Areas

1. **Authentication Flow**: Magic link request and verification
2. **Real-time Updates**: 30-second price refresh functionality
3. **Trade History**: Proper display with error handling
4. **Suggestion System**: Rate limiting and admin functionality
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatibility

### Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Immediate testing start (no setup delays)
- ‚úÖ Financial calculations verified as 100% accurate
- ‚úÖ Clear pass/fail determinations for each feature tested
- ‚úÖ Actionable bug reports with reproduction steps
- ‚úÖ Visual evidence supporting all findings
- ‚úÖ Risk assessment for any financial calculation errors

## üîÑ Error Handling for Financial Applications

### Standard Error Response

- **URL unreachable**: Report to human, do not retry
- **Database connection errors**: Report immediately with error details
- **Prisma client errors**: Document and report, do not attempt fixes
- **Financial calculation discrepancies**: Flag as critical and escalate immediately
- **Authentication failures**: Test and document, report security implications

### Critical Financial Error Detection

**Immediate Escalation Required** for:

- Portfolio values that don't match expected calculations
- Trading operations that result in incorrect user balances
- Satoshi amounts with decimal places
- BigInt serialization failures
- Price discrepancies exceeding 1% tolerance
- Any error in cost basis or P&L calculations

### Focus Areas Based on Main Claude Instructions

**Trading System Focus**:

- Asset purchase flow with BTC conversion accuracy
- Sell operation with 24-hour lock validation
- FIFO cost basis calculations for tax purposes
- Trade history accuracy and proper formatting

**Portfolio System Focus**:

- Real-time portfolio valuation updates
- Performance comparison vs holding BTC
- Holdings display accuracy and refresh timing
- P&L calculation validation across different scenarios

**Authentication System Focus**:

- Magic link generation and validation
- JWT token handling and session persistence
- Admin privilege validation and security
- Rate limiting enforcement for suggestions

## üö® Critical Testing Workflow

### Pre-Fix Bug Documentation

When testing reported bugs:

1. **Reproduce Issue**: Follow exact steps to reproduce the problem
2. **Document Current State**: Screenshot current incorrect behavior
3. **Expected vs Actual**: Clearly document what should happen vs what does happen
4. **Financial Impact**: Assess if bug affects user balances or calculations

### Post-Fix Validation (MANDATORY)

After any bug fix implementation:

1. **Re-test Specific Issue**: Verify the exact bug is resolved
2. **Regression Testing**: Ensure fix didn't break other functionality
3. **Financial Validation**: For trading/portfolio bugs, verify all calculations are accurate
4. **Performance Check**: Ensure fix doesn't impact system performance

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE**: Never consider a financial bug fix complete without agent confirmation

### Example Critical Test Scenario

```
Scenario: Portfolio Performance Calculation Bug
1. Document: Current performance shows +15% when it should show -5%
2. Test: Multiple portfolio states with known expected values
3. Verify: After fix, all performance calculations match expected results
4. Regression: Test trading, selling, and real-time updates still work
5. Confirm: Performance calculation is now accurate across all scenarios
```
