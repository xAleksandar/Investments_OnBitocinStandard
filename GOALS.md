# Bitcoin Investment Game - Project Goals & Vision

## 🎯 Core Concept

**"Can you beat Bitcoin?"** - A gamified investment platform where users get 1 virtual Bitcoin and try to outperform simply holding BTC by trading it for stocks, commodities, and other assets. Everything is measured in satoshis instead of fiat currency, creating a Bitcoin-centric perspective on investing.
